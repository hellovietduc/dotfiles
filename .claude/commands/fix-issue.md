Linear issue ID: $ARGUMENTS

Use Linear MCP tools to fetch details about issue above. If the details are unclear or ambiguous, ASK the user for it before executing the next steps.

Once understood the issue, trace the root cause. Bugs often manifest deep in the call stack. Your instinct is to fix where the error appears, but that's treating a symptom. Core principle: Trace backward through the call chain until you find the original trigger, then present to the user how you're going to fix it.
