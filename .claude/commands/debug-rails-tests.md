Read $ARGUMENTS

Your job is to identify all the test cases and the start line number for each of them, then run the following command to run that specific test case:

```
bin/rails t <path_to_test_file>:<line_number>
```

Make sure you `cd` to `services/rails` folder first.

If the test case fails, pause and give me the full output. If the test case passes, continue with the next test case.
